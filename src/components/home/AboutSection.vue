    <p class="capitalize xl:w-1/2 text-stone-500 mb-8 pl-[15px]">
      Hello, <span style="font-weight: bolder">I’m Chandan,</span> and I’m currently immersed in the
      fascinating
      <span style="font-weight: bolder">worlds of psychology, journalism, and computer science</span
      >, with a focus on C programming. This unique combination of fields allows me to explore the
      intricacies of the human mind, the power of storytelling, and the logic of coding. Psychology
      helps me understand behavior and mental processes, journalism equips me with the skills to
      communicate effectively and uncover truths, while C programming challenges me to think
      critically and solve problems through structured, efficient code. Together, these disciplines
      create a dynamic synergy, enabling me to approach challenges with a blend of creativity,
      analytical thinking, and technical expertise. Join me as I navigate this exciting journey of
      learning and growth, sharing insights and discoveries along the way!
